Section A
 Task1: 
  CREATE DATABASE Library; 
  CREATE TABLE Book
  (
   Book_no integer,
   Title varchar(100),
   Subject varchar(25)
  );

  CREATE TABLE Customer
  (
   User_id integer,
   Name varchar(30),
   Date_of_birth date
  );

  CREATE TABLE Loan
  (
   User_id integer,
   Book_no integer,
   Date_due date,
   Fine money
  );

--Note: As there is no money data type in mysql, the alternative type for recording money or currency can be decimal rather than float cause float will cause rounding errors when it comes to big sums. Since this assessment is not specific for mysql, I just use the data type money to record fines.

Task2
 ALTER TABLE Book
 ADD (Author varchar(30), Publisher varchar(60), ISNB integer);
 
 ALTER TABLE Loan
 ADD (Paid boolean);

 ALTER TABLE Customer
 ADD (Address varchar(130), Loan_status boolean);
