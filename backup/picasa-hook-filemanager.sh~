#---------< Hook File >------------------------------------------------------
#
#       Picasa 'Hook' file to allow Picasa to be more closely
#   integrated with your desktop.
#
#   Picasa tries to integrate nicely with the Linux desktop where
#   and when it can.  However, Linux does not have standard or
#   well defined interfaces for many functions.
#
#   These hook files are provided by Google to allow users to
#   fine tune their integration of Picasa with their particular
#   Linux desktop environment.
#
#---------< hook-filemanager >------------------------------------------------
#
#   picasa-hook-filemanager.sh
#
#   This script is passed a command line with a single file name
#
#   The ideal behavior is for the file manager to open the directory
#   that contains that file, with that file highlighted.
#
#   If this script exits with a status of 0, then Picasa will
#   assume that you have handled the request, and will not perform
#   any further processing.
#
#   To use this file:
#       copy the picasa-hook-filemanager.sh.template file to
#       some place in your path, and name it picasa-hook-filemanager.sh.
#       Then edit the script to add the functionality you need
#
